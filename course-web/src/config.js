<b>Description</b>&#8212;This course covers Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research topics focusing on model uncertainty and decision-making. We will cover a range of models, from linear regression to probabilistic forecasts and AI foundation models, and explore how to help human users understand and manage uncertainty in these computational models. Core topics include

<font class='topic'>statistical communication</font>, 
<font class='topic'>explainability</font>, 
<font class='topic'>decision-making</font>, 
<font class='topic'>uncertainty visualization</font>, and 
<font class='topic'>LLM uncertainty</font>.

 This course is <b>MS/PhD qualifying</b> in Software Engineering/Programming Languages/HCI.  The class format includes a combination of presentations, discussions, and lectures. 
 

</p>

<p>
<b>Course objectives</b>&#8212;Students who take this course should have an interest in HCI and/or uncertainty communication. Prior experience with HCI or Visualization courses is beneficial but not required. Assignments are designed to learn project management skills and to provide practical experience for peer-reviewing.

By the end of this course, students should be able to 
<ul>
<li>Describe the background and open problems within the covered topics. </li>
<li>Propose new research projects based on the learned topics. </li>
<li>Choose and justify appropriate HCI research methods for their projects. </li>
<li>Understand the peer-reviewing process in HCI. </li>
<li>Improve their communication and presentation skills. </li>
</ul>


This course is ideal for first or second-year graduate students. Senior PhD students interested in these topics are also welcome.
</p>

export const collaboration_policy = `
<p> 
We encourage collaboration and discussion among students. However, solo assignments should be primarily completed on your own. You are welcome to seek help from the course staff during office hours or use Canvas to ask questions and discuss with other students. For group projects, collaboration is encouraged on all aspects of the project and the paper.
</p>

export const late_policy = `
You have <b>4 slack days</b> to use for any assignments or responses that have a late policy. These days are intended for minor illnesses, special occasions (e.g., interviews), or unexpected scenarios. Late submissions not covered by a slack day will incur a 10% grade deduction per day. Inform us before the deadline and specify how many days you'd like to use.
